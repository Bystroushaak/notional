    <h1>Mad Tea Party</h1>

    <!-- Some special block types... -->

    <blockquote>
        There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare
        and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast
        asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it,
        and talking over its head. "Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse," thought Alice;
        "only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind."
    </blockquote>

    <pre>
The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner
of it: "No room! No room!" they cried out when they saw Alice coming. "There's
plenty of room!" said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair
at one end of the table.

        Once upon a time there were three little sisters; and their names were:

        and they lived at the bottom of a well.

        "What did they <em>live</em> on?" said Alice, who always took a great interest in
        questions of <u>eating</u> and <u>drinking</u>.

    <p class="story">
        "They lived on <strong>treacle</strong>," said the Dormouse, after thinking a
        minute or two.

        "They couldn't have done that, <del>you know,</del>" Alice gently remarked;
        "they'd have been ill."

        "So they were," said the Dormouse; "very <code>ill</code>."
